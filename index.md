### About Me

I'm a Data Analyst with the Collection Development Department at the University of North Texas Libraries, and a PhD student at the UNT Department of Computer Science. In my work with the library, I'm the creator and current maintainer for the PySUSHI library (used for automating SUSHI data collection and pipeline development), as well as an active researcher in forecasting usage trends and library resource classification. I'm a relatively recent arrival in the world of libraries; I previously worked at AccentCare Inc, where I developed the PaSeMPB system for patient classification. If you've found this site because you saw me at a conference talking about PySUSHI or PaSeMPB, feel free to drop me a line via my email in my profile and say hi!

### 2020 Conference Speaking Schedule:
ER&L, Core Forum, CTLC


### Active Projects
Release 2 of PySUSHI is available [here](https://github.com/unt-libraries/PySUSHI), and release 3.0 is on-track to be release in mid-2021 with a reworked and expanded GUI, along with the necessary numerical expansions for integrated forecasting.

### Inactive Projects
PaSeMPB development has gone dormant since 2019, as every member of our team has now moved on to new adventures.
