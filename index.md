Welcome! You've found the LZ for my blog. I'm a Data Engineer at W.R. Berkley by day, and a graduate student in the Department of Statistics at Texas A&M in the evenings.

I'm usually writing about some combination of my work on home lab projects, my research in survival analysis methods and econometrics modeling, or my perpetual attempts to garden.
